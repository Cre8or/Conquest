## ðŸš§ DISCLAIMER ðŸš§

This project is under active development, and currently in **closed-beta**[^1]. It is not yet suited for general use - expect errors, performance issues and even game crashes. Nonetheless, I am working as fast as I can, and aim to get the first public release out within this year.

# Conquest

## Introduction

**Conquest** is a casual yet intense combat gamemode for ArmA 3, that takes heavy inspiration from genre-defining classics such as *Battlefield 2* and *Battlefield 3*.

**Key features:**
- 2 (or 3) sides compete for sectors until only one side remains
- Integrated AI units ("bots") who play objectives and assist their team mates
- Choose your side, role, and spawnpoint from the custom in-game respawn menu
- Playable in both singleplayer and multiplayer
- Simplified damage system that significantly lowers time-to-kill
- Custom damage feedback (bullet impact sounds, hit markers)
- Custom UIs including kill feed, score feed, 3D nametags and combat area rendering
- Heavily optimised towards best client performance

## Usage

This project can be divided into two components: the gamemode framework, and the mission data. Currently, the repository combines both components into one ready-to-play mission, which takes place on the **Malden** terrain.

**TODO**: Go into detail on how to build a mission using the framework
